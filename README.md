## üîç Overview

- **Platform**: Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)
- **Challenge**: SOC Alpha 2  
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Analyzing event logs
  - Filtering for suspicious IPs and login attempts
  - Investigating PowerShell activity
  - Identifying malicious queries and potential exploitation tools

## üèπ Threat Hunting Steps

### üîπ **Hunt 1: Suspicious Logon Activity**
1. **Filtered event logs** for a specific date to narrow down suspicious activities.
2. **Identified highest frequency IP addresses** associated with events.
3. **Checked event details**, revealing **logon type 3**, indicating a network-based logon.
4. **Correlated event IDs** to track successful logins from suspicious IPs.

### üîπ **Hunt 2: PowerShell Execution**
1. **Filtered logs for `powershell.exe` executions**.
2. **Investigated exclusion paths** to determine if execution bypassed Defender.
3. **Googled known techniques** to check if bypass methods were used.

### üîπ **Hunt 3: Malicious Queries & Execution**
1. **Filtered by event ID, query name, and execution process IDs**.
2. **Investigated URLs** associated with suspicious DNS queries.
3. **Mapped execution process ID to potential attacker persistence mechanisms**.

### üîπ **Hunt 4: Advanced Tooling (Mimikatz)**
1. **Checked for all relevant event IDs**, but initially found no matches.
2. **Searched specifically for Mimikatz**, a well-known credential dumping tool.
3. **Analyzed execution artifacts**, confirming potential credential compromise.
